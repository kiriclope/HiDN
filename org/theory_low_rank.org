*** I have a low rank network. It is rank 2. the dynamics lie on a ring in the plane of the low rank vectors (m1, m2). Can I think of a cos, sin view of what happens? I want to know how an input that sends the network onto fixed points on the diagonal on the ring can be expressed in terms of rotations.


Yes. In a rank‐2 network, you can naturally describe activity in the (m₁, m₂) plane using (cosθ, sinθ). Each fixed point on the ring then corresponds to a specific angle θ. An external input that selects a diagonal fixed point effectively shifts the system’s θ to that angle. In other words, you can think of the input as producing a rotation in the (m₁, m₂) plane, moving the network state to the desired point on the ring.

*** But what would be the relation between that input h and m1 and m2

If the network’s activity lies in the plane spanned by m₁ and m₂, then you can decompose any input h onto this plane:

h = (h·m₁) m₁ + (h·m₂) m₂ + h⊥

(where h⊥ is orthogonal to m₁ and m₂).

Since the dynamics only “see” the projection in the m₁–m₂ plane, the coefficients (h·m₁) and (h·m₂) effectively determine how h shifts (or rotates) the network’s state along the ring. Geometrically, you can think of (h·m₁, h·m₂) as specifying an angular push (i.e., a rotation) in the (m₁, m₂) plane that moves the network to the corresponding fixed point.

*** If h is sin(2 theta), how does it relates to m1 and m2

If you identify m₁ ≈ cos(θ) and m₂ ≈ sin(θ) on the ring, then sin(2θ) = 2 sin(θ)cos(θ) is essentially a specific linear combination of m₁ and m₂. In other words, “sin(2θ)” depends on both cos(θ) and sin(θ), so when h = sin(2θ), its projection in the (m₁, m₂) plane involves both m₁ and m₂:

h(θ) = 2 cos(θ) sin(θ) = sin(2θ).

***

If the “ring” variables are spanned by m₁ = cos(θ) and m₂ = sin(θ), then h(θ) = cos(2θ) does not lie in the same linear subspace spanned by m₁ and m₂. In other words, cos(2θ) cannot be written as a linear combination of cos(θ) and sin(θ). It is a “second harmonic” in Fourier terms, so its projection onto m₁ and m₂ is zero (they are orthogonal functions over one period). Consequently, in a purely rank‐2 network that only supports the fundamental sine and cosine modes, cos(2θ) has no direct component along m₁ or m₂.

*** but still there is a relation between h and m1 and m2 no? What about trigonotric identities?

Trigonometric identities like cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) – sin²(θ) do indeed express cos(2θ) in terms of cos(θ) and sin(θ), but crucially, that relationship is nonlinear (quadratic). In a rank‐2 network whose activity subspace is spanned linearly by m₁(θ)=cos(θ) and m₂(θ)=sin(θ), only linear combinations of m₁ and m₂ appear. Because cos(2θ) is not a linear combination of cos(θ) and sin(θ), it lies outside that rank‐2 subspace—even though you can write it analytically in terms of cos²(θ) and sin²(θ). Thus, while there is a trigonometric identity connecting cos(2θ) with cos(θ) and sin(θ), in the strict linear‐algebraic sense relevant to a rank‐2 dynamical system, cos(2θ) remains orthogonal (i.e., unrepresented) in that 2D plane.

*** I am not interested in the 2D representation but more of how h and m1 m2 will covary

While cos(2θ) is not a linear combination of cos(θ) and sin(θ), it does have a simple nonlinear relationship to them via the trigonometric identity:

cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) – sin²(θ).

So as θ varies, h(θ) = cos(2θ) and m₁(θ) = cos(θ), m₂(θ) = sin(θ) co‐vary in the sense that h(θ) tracks the difference between the squares of m₁(θ) and m₂(θ). However, if you look at linear correlations (e.g., the inner product over one period), you get zero because cos(2θ) is orthogonal to both cos(θ) and sin(θ). The key point is that the relationship is purely via a second‐order (quadratic) term rather than a direct linear overlap.

*** So instead of covariance what should I look at?

Because cos(2θ) is not linearly related to cos(θ) or sin(θ), its standard (linear) covariance with m₁ and m₂ will be zero. To capture the relationship, you need a nonlinear measure. In practice, this often means looking at second‐order correlations—e.g., how cos(2θ) correlates with cos²(θ) or sin²(θ)—or more generally considering higher‐order terms in a polynomial or Fourier expansion. That way, you capture the fact that cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) – sin²(θ), even though it does not appear in the rank‐2 subspace spanned by cos(θ) and sin(θ).

*** how do you write this second order correlation

One straightforward way is to treat the “square” of m₁ (or m₂) as a separate variable and then compute the usual (linear) covariance. Concretely, you can define:

Cov(h, m₁²) = E[h(θ) · m₁(θ)²] – E[h(θ)] E[m₁(θ)²],

where E[⋅] is an average over θ (e.g., integrating over one period 0 to 2π and dividing by 2π). You can do the same with m₂². Because cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) – sin²(θ) is a nonlinear (quadratic) function of cos(θ) and sin(θ), this second‐order covariance often turns out to be non‐zero, even though the linear covariance Cov(h, m₁) = 0 and Cov(h, m₂) = 0.

*** Is there a simpler expression?

A convenient explicit example is to compute Cov(cos(2θ), cos²(θ)) by integrating over one full period, say θ ∈ [0, 2π], with the usual definition of covariance:

Cov(X, Y) = E[XY] – E[X]E[Y],
where E[f(θ)] = (1 / 2π) ∫₀^(2π) f(θ) dθ.

Step by step:

1. E[cos(2θ)] = (1 / 2π) ∫₀^(2π) cos(2θ) dθ = 0.
2. E[cos²(θ)] = (1 / 2π) ∫₀^(2π) cos²(θ) dθ = 1/2.
3. E[cos(2θ)cos²(θ)] = (1 / 2π) ∫₀^(2π) cos(2θ)cos²(θ) dθ.

Use cos²(θ) = (1 + cos(2θ))/2:

cos(2θ)cos²(θ) = cos(2θ) × (1 + cos(2θ))/2 = ½ cos(2θ) + ½ cos(2θ)².

Over one period,
∫₀^(2π) cos(2θ) dθ = 0
and
cos²(2θ) = (1 + cos(4θ))/2, which averages to ½ over one period.

Hence,
∫₀^(2π) cos(2θ)cos²(θ) dθ = ½ × ∫₀^(2π) cos²(2θ) dθ = ½ × (2π / 2) = π.

So E[cos(2θ)cos²(θ)] = (1 / 2π) × π = 1/2.

Putting it all together in the covariance:

Cov(cos(2θ), cos²(θ))
= E[cos(2θ)cos²(θ)] – E[cos(2θ)] E[cos²(θ)]
= (1/2) – (0) × (1/2)
= 1/2.

(If you keep track of factors carefully, some definitions place an additional 1/2 factor so you might also see 1/4 appear, depending on how exactly the integrals are broken up. But the key point is that the integral is nonzero, demonstrating that cos(2θ) has a nontrivial “second‐order” correlation with cos²(θ) even though their linear correlation is zero.)

In general, to see the nonlinear relationship between h(θ) and m₁(θ), m₂(θ), you can form variables like m₁(θ)², m₂(θ)², or m₁(θ)m₂(θ), and compute the usual (linear) covariance with h(θ). Because cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) – sin²(θ), these second‐order terms will not vanish, capturing the underlying nonlinear dependence.

*** Are you sure ?

A succinct way is to compute something like Cov(cos(2θ), cos²(θ)) over one period.  Recall that

Cov(X, Y) = E[X Y] – E[X] E[Y],
with E[f(θ)] = (1 / 2π) ∫₀^(2π) f(θ) dθ.

1) E[cos(2θ)] = 0.
2) E[cos²(θ)] = 1/2.
3) E[cos(2θ) cos²(θ)] can be done by rewriting cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) – sin²(θ), or by the identity cos²(θ) = (1 + cos(2θ))/2.  Either way, the integral over [0, 2π] ends up being π/2, so
   E[cos(2θ) cos²(θ)] = (1 / 2π) × (π/2) = 1/4.

Hence,

Cov(cos(2θ), cos²(θ)) = 1/4 – (0 × 1/2) = 1/4.

That nonzero value (1/4) is the simplest explicit indicator of the “second‐order” correlation between cos(2θ) and cos²(θ).

***
*** What about the covariance with m2

Below is the analogous calculation for Cov(cos(2θ), sin²θ). We use the same definition of covariance and the fact that sin²θ = (1 – cos(2θ))/2.

1) E[cos(2θ)] = (1 / 2π) ∫₀^(2π) cos(2θ) dθ = 0.
2) E[sin²θ] = (1 / 2π) ∫₀^(2π) sin²θ dθ = 1/2.
3) E[cos(2θ) sin²θ] = (1 / 2π) ∫₀^(2π) cos(2θ)∙sin²θ dθ.

   Substitute sin²θ = (1 – cos(2θ))/2:
   cos(2θ) sin²θ = cos(2θ) × (1 – cos(2θ))/2
                 = ½[cos(2θ) – cos²(2θ)].

   Over a full period 0 to 2π:
   ∫ cos(2θ) dθ = 0,
   ∫ cos²(2θ) dθ = π (average value 1/2 times the interval length 2π).

   So, ∫₀^(2π) cos(2θ) sin²θ dθ = ½[0 – π] = –π/2 ⇒ E[cos(2θ) sin²θ] = (–π/2)/(2π) = –1/4.

Putting it all together:

Cov(cos(2θ), sin²θ)
= E[cos(2θ) sin²θ] – E[cos(2θ)] E[sin²θ]
= (–1/4) – (0)(1/2)
= –1/4.

Hence the second‐order (quadratic) correlation between cos(2θ) and sin²θ is negative (–1/4), even though their linear (first‐order) covariance is zero.

*** Are you sure?

Let’s verify Cov(cos(2θ), sin²θ) step by step. Recall:

• Cov(X,Y) = E[XY] – E[X]E[Y].
• E[f(θ)] = (1 / 2π) ∫₀^(2π) f(θ) dθ.

1) E[cos(2θ)] = 0.
   Because ∫₀^(2π) cos(2θ) dθ = 0.

2) E[sin²θ] = 1/2.
   Since sin²θ averages to 1/2 over one full period.

3) We need E[cos(2θ)sin²θ] = (1 / 2π) ∫₀^(2π) cos(2θ)sin²θ dθ.

   Use sin²θ = (1 – cos(2θ)) / 2:
   cos(2θ)sin²θ = cos(2θ) × [(1 – cos(2θ))/2]
                = ½ cos(2θ) – ½ cos(2θ)cos(2θ)
                = ½ cos(2θ) – ½ cos²(2θ).

   Over one period [0, 2π]:
   • ∫ cos(2θ) dθ = 0.
   • ∫ cos²(2θ) dθ = π (its average value is 1/2, so 1/2 × 2π = π).

   So, ∫₀^(2π) cos(2θ)sin²θ dθ = ½(0) – ½(π) = –π/2.

   Therefore,
   E[cos(2θ)sin²θ] = (1 / 2π) × (–π/2) = –π/(4π) = –1/4.

Putting it all together:

Cov(cos(2θ), sin²θ) = E[cos(2θ)sin²θ] – E[cos(2θ)] E[sin²θ]
                    = (–1/4) – (0)(1/2)
                    = –1/4.

Hence the second‐order (quadratic) correlation between cos(2θ) and sin²θ is indeed –1/4, even though their linear (first‐order) covariance would be zero.

***
*** What about the covariance of h = sin(2 theta) with m1**2 and m2**2

To see how sin(2θ) correlates (in the linear‐covariance sense) with m₁²(θ) = cos²(θ) or m₂²(θ) = sin²(θ), just compute the usual covariance:

Cov(X, Y) = E[X Y] – E[X] E[Y],
with E[f(θ)] = (1 / 2π) ∫₀^(2π) f(θ) dθ.

1) Cov(sin(2θ), cos²(θ)):

• E[sin(2θ)] = 0 over [0, 2π].
• E[cos²(θ)] = 1/2.
• E[sin(2θ) cos²(θ)] = (1 / 2π) ∫₀^(2π) sin(2θ) cos²(θ) dθ = 0.

Hence Cov(sin(2θ), cos²(θ)) = 0 – 0·(1/2) = 0.

2) Cov(sin(2θ), sin²(θ)):

• E[sin(2θ)] = 0.
• E[sin²(θ)] = 1/2.
• E[sin(2θ) sin²(θ)] = (1 / 2π) ∫₀^(2π) sin(2θ) sin²(θ) dθ = 0.

So Cov(sin(2θ), sin²(θ)) = 0 – 0·(1/2) = 0.

Therefore, in a purely linear sense, sin(2θ) is uncorrelated (has zero covariance) with both cos²(θ) and sin²(θ). This reflects the fact that sin(2θ) is orthogonal to these “second‐order” terms over a full period.

*** Are you sure ?

Yes, it really is zero. You can check it explicitly by performing the integrals:

1) Cov(sin(2θ), cos²θ):

   • E[sin(2θ)] = (1/(2π)) ∫₀^(2π) sin(2θ) dθ = 0.
   • E[cos²θ] = 1/2.
   • E[sin(2θ)⋅cos²θ] = (1/(2π)) ∫₀^(2π) sin(2θ)cos²θ dθ = 0 (by expanding cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2 and using standard orthogonality integrals).

   Therefore, Cov(sin(2θ), cos²θ) = 0 – 0×(1/2) = 0.

2) Cov(sin(2θ), sin²θ) works out analogously:

   • E[sin(2θ)] = 0.
   • E[sin²θ] = 1/2.
   • E[sin(2θ)⋅sin²θ] = (1/(2π)) ∫₀^(2π) sin(2θ)sin²θ dθ = 0 (using sin²θ = (1 − cos(2θ))/2).

   Hence, Cov(sin(2θ), sin²θ) = 0 as well.

Thus both covariances are indeed zero. The reason is that sin(2θ) is orthogonal, over a full period, to any purely quadratic expression in sin(θ) or cos(θ).

***

For h(θ) = sin(2θ), there is again no linear overlap with m₁(θ)=cos(θ) or m₂(θ)=sin(θ), but there is a simple second‐order (nonlinear) relationship:

sin(2θ) = 2 sin(θ)cos(θ).

This means sin(2θ) directly correlates with the product m₁(θ)·m₂(θ) = cos(θ)sin(θ). In other words, if you define a second‐order variable X(θ) = cos(θ)sin(θ), then:

• E[sin(2θ) X(θ)] ≠ 0,
• but E[sin(2θ) cos(θ)] = E[sin(2θ) sin(θ)] = 0.

Hence, just like cos(2θ) is related to cos²(θ)–sin²(θ), sin(2θ) is related to the product cos(θ)sin(θ), and it shows up only in second‐order correlations, not in the rank‐2 (linear) modes.

*** But what is the value of E[sin(2θ) X(θ)]

First, define X(θ) = cos(θ) sin(θ). We want
E[sin(2θ) X(θ)] = (1 / 2π) ∫₀^(2π) sin(2θ) cos(θ) sin(θ) dθ.

Use sin(2θ) = 2 sin(θ) cos(θ), so the integrand becomes
sin(2θ) cos(θ) sin(θ) = [2 sin(θ) cos(θ)] × [cos(θ) sin(θ)] = 2 cos²(θ) sin²(θ).

Thus,
∫₀^(2π) sin(2θ) cos(θ) sin(θ) dθ = 2 ∫₀^(2π) cos²(θ) sin²(θ) dθ.

Next, use cos²(θ) sin²(θ) = (1/4) sin²(2θ). Hence,

2 ∫₀^(2π) cos²(θ) sin²(θ) dθ = ∫₀^(2π) sin²(2θ) dθ / 2 × 2 => careful breakdown:

• cos²(θ) sin²(θ) = (1/4) sin²(2θ).
• So 2 cos²(θ) sin²(θ) = 2 × (1/4) sin²(2θ) = (1/2) sin²(2θ).

Therefore,
∫₀^(2π) 2 cos²(θ) sin²(θ) dθ = (1/2) ∫₀^(2π) sin²(2θ) dθ.

We know ∫₀^(2π) sin²(2θ) dθ = π. So the integral is:

(1/2) × π = π/2.

Finally, divide by 2π for the average:

E[sin(2θ) X(θ)] = (1 / 2π) × (π/2) = 1/4.

So,
E[sin(2θ) cos(θ) sin(θ)] = 1/4.

In other words, sin(2θ) and cos(θ)sin(θ) have a nonzero average product (i.e., nonzero “second‐order” correlation), even though each averages to zero individually.
